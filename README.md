# Practice Problems on: `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`

## Overview
This document tracks your progress as you practice and master the usage of `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` in JavaScript. Each section contains problem descriptions, status updates, and space for notes or reflections.

---

## **1. Transform and Sort Names**
**Description:** Extract names from an array of objects, convert them to uppercase, and sort alphabetically.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Notes:**

---

## **2. Find the Longest Word**
**Description:** Find the length of the longest word in an array of strings.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Notes:**

---

## **3. Filter and Sum**
**Description:** Filter out odd numbers from an array and sum up the even numbers.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Notes:**

---

## **4. Group by Category**
**Description:** Group products by category and return an object with category keys and arrays of product names as values.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Notes:** Here using map creates a new array by transforming each element of input array, more suitable for transforming data. Instead, reduce is a better fit for grouping data into categories since it allows building an object or multiple arrays in one go.

---

## **5. Calculate Average**
**Description:** Calculate the average of an array of numbers, rounded to 2 decimal places.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Notes:** Use dynamic division to calculate average instead of hardcoding the values

Why This is Better?
• Dynamic Solution: Automatically adjusts to any array size.
• Less Error-Prone: No need to manually count the students.

## **6. Top Scorer**
**Description:** Find the name of the top scorer from an array of players with `name` and `score` properties.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Notes:**

---

## **7. Custom Reduce Function**
**Description:** Write your own implementation of the `reduce` function using a `for` loop.
- **Status:** Pending
- **Notes:**
